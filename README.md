# Decision Support System for Data Science Tool Selection

A full-stack web-based decision-support application that recommends the most suitable programming language (Python, R, or SQL) for specific data science tasks.

This project was developed as part of my MSc Computing dissertation and demonstrates practical implementation of a research-driven software solution.

## Overview

Choosing the right programming language in data science can be challenging. Many users select Python, R, or SQL based on familiarity rather than task suitability.

This application provides an intelligent recommendation system that helps users select the most appropriate tool based on:

* Task type
* Performance requirements
* User preference
* Benchmark data

It improves efficiency, reduces tool confusion, and supports better decision-making in data science workflows.

## Key Features

* Interactive web-based interface
* Recommends Python, R, or SQL based on task
* Performance-based decision engine
* Beginner and expert mode options
* Hybrid workflow recommendations
* Clean and responsive dashboard UI
* Research-backed logic and evaluation

---

## Technologies Used

**Frontend**

* React (Vite)
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS

**Backend**

* Node.js
* Express.js

**Other Concepts**

* Decision-support systems
* Data benchmarking
* Performance evaluation
* User-driven recommendations

---

## How the System Works

1. User selects a data science task
2. Chooses preferences (speed, memory, usability)
3. System analyses benchmark metrics
4. Decision engine calculates best tool
5. Recommended programming language is displayed

The system can also recommend hybrid workflows using multiple tools.
